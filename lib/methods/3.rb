# Create a method that returns a sorted array based on its value, but reversed.

# Example: 
#
#     reverse_order([1, 5, 7, 3, 0])
#     # => [7, 5, 3, 1, 0]
#     reverse_order([7, 4, 5])
#     # => [7, 5, 4]
#     reverse_order([-1, -5, 3])
#     # => [3, -1, -5]

# method
def reverse_order(array)
  # code
